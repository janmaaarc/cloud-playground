# Cloud Playground

**Hands-on AWS Lab & Projects Repository**  
This repository is dedicated to practicing **AWS cloud computing and cloud security skills** using **AWS Free Tier**. It contains mini-projects that demonstrate knowledge and practical experience with EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).  

---

## Project Goals

The purpose of this repository is to **build practical cloud experience** while reinforcing foundational knowledge gained from certifications and courses.  
Specific goals:

1. **Compute & Storage:** Launch EC2 instances and host static websites on S3 + CloudFront.  
2. **Security & IAM:** Implement secure IAM users, roles, and policies. Explore CloudTrail for auditing.  
3. **Networking:** Create VPCs with public/private subnets, security groups, and NACLs.  
4. **Serverless & APIs:** Deploy Lambda functions and expose them via API Gateway.  
5. **Monitoring & Alerts:** Configure CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications.  
6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automate deployments with Terraform or CloudFormation.  
7. **Portfolio Development:** Document projects with architecture diagrams, screenshots, and step-by-step instructions.  

**Outcome:** By completing these projects, this repo demonstrates **real-world AWS skills** and provides a **hands-on portfolio** to show potential employers.
